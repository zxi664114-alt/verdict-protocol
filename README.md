## Overview

Verdict Protocol is an AI-powered on-chain intelligence layer built for real users.

On one side: a **smart money tracking and on-chain anomaly detection system** — delivering live risk signals, whale movements, and wallet intelligence across 8 EVM chains through a Telegram Bot built for how traders actually operate.

On the other: a **gamified, shareable consumer AI application** that turns any on-chain disagreement into a live wager — between friends, rivals, or communities — with results that spread as verifiable, shareable cards.

> Two products. One AI Judge core. Built on BNB Chain. Expanding to Mantle.

## 🤖 Track 02 — AI Alpha & Data Intelligence

Information asymmetry is a structural problem across all of Web3. Verdict Protocol addresses this through two channels: a **Chrome extension** and a **Telegram Bot**, both powered by the same AI Judge core.

The Chrome extension auto-detects contract addresses on DexScreener, GMGN, four.meme, and Ave.ai, delivering real-time risk scores and AI verdicts in seconds. The Telegram Bot provides deep wallet scanning, real-time whale tracking, and large transfer monitoring — covering 8 EVM chains.

> This is intelligent information infrastructure for every on-chain participant.

**Data layer:** Moralis multi-chain API  
**Inference layer:** Large Language Model (LLM)  
**Live demo:** [@VerdictProtocol_Bot]

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/scan <address> <chain>` | Deep wallet scan + AI verdict |
| `/judge <address> <chain>` | AI Judge ruling |
| `/whale <chain>` | Real-time whale tracker |
| `/suspect <address>` | Suspect wallet analysis |
| `/watch <address> <chain>` | Monitor wallet for large transfers |
| `/watchlist` | View all monitored wallets |
| `/unwatch <address>` | Stop monitoring a wallet |

### Supported Chains

| Chain | ID | Chain | ID |
|-------|----|-------|----|
| BNB Chain | `bnb` | Arbitrum | `arb` |
| Ethereum | `eth` | Optimism | `op` |
| Polygon | `polygon` | Base | `base` |
| Mantle | `mantle` | Avalanche | `avax` |

## ⚖️ Track 04 — Protocol Bet

Disagreement is the most frequent event in on-chain markets — over token performance, project direction, or any on-chain outcome. **Protocol Bet converts any verifiable on-chain dispute into a settleable wager.**

Use cases are highly diverse:
- 🔒 **Private** — send a bet link directly to a friend for a one-on-one wager
- 🌐 **Open** — launch a public challenge and let anyone take the other side
- 🔥 **KOL vs KOL** — stage a public showdown between communities with opposing views
- 🤖 **vs AI** — go head-to-head against the AI Judge itself

After settlement, results are automatically generated as **shareable cards** — on-chain verifiable, immediately readable.

> No trusted intermediary required. The initiator sets the target, direction, time window, and stake amount. Once accepted, the contract locks funds and settles automatically on expiry. **Transparent, automated, unstoppable.**

## 🔍 Track 05 — AI DevTools: Contract Audit Assistant

Smart contract risk and Gas efficiency are universal pain points for every Mantle developer and on-chain user. Verdict Protocol's AI audit module delivers **instant pre-purchase contract risk analysis**.

Core detection capabilities:

| Risk Type | What We Detect |
|-----------|----------------|
| 🍯 Honeypot | Sell restrictions, transfer locks, token trap patterns |
| 🔑 Privilege Risk | Hidden mint functions, dangerous admin permissions |
| 🚫 Blacklist | Address-level trading or transfer blocks |
| 💧 Liquidity Risk | LP lock status, unlock timing, drainable pool flags |
| 📊 Holder Concentration | Top wallet distribution and dump risk signals |

Additionally, Verdict Protocol provides **Gas consumption analysis and optimisation** tailored to Mantle's network characteristics, helping developers identify high-cost call paths before deployment.

All capabilities are available via **open API** for third-party platform integration — native DevTools infrastructure for the Mantle ecosystem.

## 🏛️ IP Arbitration

Originality and IP disputes are a deep governance problem across Web3 — from on-chain assets to protocol branding, conflicts are widespread but have long lacked a credible resolution mechanism.

Verdict Protocol's IP arbitration module allows anyone to file an on-chain IP claim. A **community jury** participates in the review process, the **AI Judge** synthesises on-chain evidence to deliver a verdict, and the result is **permanently recorded on-chain**.

> This is the infrastructure layer that moves Web3 creator economies from unverified claims toward accountable, on-chain truth.
